# MapTrackApp

Sometimes people forget routes
This is a very major problem among people, they just don't want to type their location and destination each and every day on maps

so this is a app where you just enter your route once and it will trace your path and stores in the database
so you can travel without having the worry to remember the path

// IMPORTANT :
this is a App I have created for my friend so it was hosted on MongoDB
if you want to use it just clone it and run on your local machine with mongoDB and ngrock installed
